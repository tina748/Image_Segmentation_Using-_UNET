## Introduction
The project focuses on improving image segmentation accuracy with a U-Net architecture. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and uses PyTorch for model training and backpropagation.

## Features
- Custom U-Net architecture implementation
- Training with Kaggle dataset
- PyTorch-based backpropagation
- High accuracy in image segmentation tasks

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishita3003/Image-Segmentation.git
   ```
   ```
   cd Image-Segmentation
   ```
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To train the model, open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook image-segmentation-using-unet.ipynb
   ```
3. Ensure the Kaggle dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.
